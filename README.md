Requirements
------------

All the exercises and samples use [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org). In addition the instructions 
presume you're using [Eclipse for Java (EE) Developers](http://www.eclipse.org) which has the [m2e](http://www.eclipse.org/m2e) plug-in installed by default. 
You can, however, use any IDE you want as long as it supports Maven.

Adding the Projects to Eclipse
------------------------------

To add the GitHub repository to your Eclipse IDE, use the following instructions:

* Move to the Git Repository Exploring perspective (Window > Open Perspective > Other > Git Repository Exploring)
* Copy the following URL to your clipboard: <git://github.com/Codecenter/courses-spring-framework.git>
* Right-click on the Git Repositories view and select Paste Repository Path or URI
* A dialog opens where URL, Host, Repository path and Protocol are already set. Click Next, Next and Finish.
* Right-click the project courses-spring-framework and select Import.
* Under Maven, select Existing Maven Projects and click Next.  
* Use Select All to check all projects and perform the import by clicking Finish.

After a while you should have all the sample projects available inside Eclipse.
